Problem:
Generate all consecutive substrings of a string in order.

Solution:
Use two nested loops. Outer loop selects the start index, inner loop builds substrings
by adding one character at a time and stores them in an array.

Algorithm Type:
nested loop traversal.

Time Complexity:
O(n²) – two nested loops over the string.

Space Complexity:
O(n²) – storing all substrings.
